# **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard**

The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a data-driven visualization tool designed to provide insights into road accident trends, causes, and patterns. This dashboard aims to help policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety organizations understand critical metrics to implement effective safety measures and reduce accidents. Built using Microsoft Excel, it incorporates advanced analytics and visualization techniques for clear and actionable insights.:

- **Accident Trends Analysis**: Visual representation of daily, monthly, and yearly road accident occurrences.

- **Cause Analysis**: Breakdown of key accident causes such as speeding, weather conditions, or driver negligence.

- **Demographics**: Analysis of victim profiles by age group, gender, and type of vehicle involved.

- **Severity Metrics**: Classification of accidents based on severity levelsâ€”minor, major, or fatal.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with complex datasets, extract meaningful insights, and create dashboards that support impactful decision-making in critical domains like road safety.
