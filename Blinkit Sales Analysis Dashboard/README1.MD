This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, enabling data-driven decisions to improve business outcomes. Built using Microsoft Excel, it leverages advanced features to ensure a user-friendly and visually compelling experience.:

- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Monitor daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends to identify growth patterns and seasonal fluctuations.

- **Customer Insights**: Analyze customer segmentation based on order frequency, average order value, and preferences.
